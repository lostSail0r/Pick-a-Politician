# Pick-a-Politician
Who do you side with? - A humorous look at politics <br>

Description: Heavily inspired by http://isidewith.com, this purpose of this game is to allow 
the user to make certain selections based on their interests and beliefs. In the background 
of this GUI application, a political score will be calculated after every selection. At the end of the game,
the user will be presented with the political candidate that most closely represents their beliefs. 
Hopefully some results will be surprising to some!  And just for fun – at the end of the game, the 
user has two additional choices besides quitting. The first would be to enter their name and save it 
to a file that stores all previous saved entries (that way users can see what other people have gotten). 
The other is a funny Donald Trump-Themed mini-game.

This program will do the following:
-	First, display detailed instructions to the user so they know what they are supposed to do.
-	Next, they will select whichever statements that they strongly agree with. 
-	Then they will select a candidate that they know that strongly dislike.
-	(Throughout these steps, an algorithm in the background is determining the user’s political views).
-	When the user is finished with his/her selections, they are to click the finish button.
-	At that point, the respective candidate will be revealed to the user.
-	If the user decides to quit, the game ends.
-	If the user wants to save his results and view other results, he can click that section.
-	If the user hits spacebar, an “Easter egg” mini-game involving a comical view of Donald Trump will begin
- If the user hits "Learn more," the webbrowser module will open the user's web browser to that respective candidates website.
